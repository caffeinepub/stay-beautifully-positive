# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable users to share daily affirmations with others through a share button.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a share button to the daily affirmation card
- Implement native share functionality using Web Share API with clipboard fallback
- Format shared messages to include the affirmation text and app attribution
- Provide visual feedback for successful sharing or copying

**User-visible outcome:** Users can tap a share button on their daily affirmation to share the message via their device's native share options or copy it to clipboard, with the shared text including attribution to the Daily Affirmations app.
