  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via a new editable track list and updated audio logic in MainPage. However, the diff shows a forbidden modification to an immutable hook file, and the provided truncation does not conclusively show the required UI elements for current-track indication and attribution.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The UI indicates the current track name when music is playing.",
      "reason": "MainPage.tsx is truncated before showing the rendered music controls/status area; the diff snippet includes state and logic but does not show any UI text that displays the current track name while playing.",

        "frontend/src/pages/MainPage.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Display attribution text for the currently selected track in the UI in a readable but unobtrusive way.",
      "reason": "Although track attribution metadata exists in the new track configuration, the MainPage.tsx diff snippet is truncated before any attribution UI is shown, so display cannot be verified from the provided diff content.",
