  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented on the frontend via toast notifications triggered only when a check-in succeeds and the returned streak value increases versus the previously cached streak. The celebratory toast is time-limited and streak data is invalidated to keep the display accurate. Some additional (non-requested) toast behaviors were also introduced.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added additional non-celebratory toast messages for various states (e.g., unauthenticated attempt, missing mood selection, generic 'Check-in successful' when streak did not increase, and treating errors as 'Already checked in today').",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks for a time-limited celebratory message when the streak is extended and for the comparison logic; it does not request new user-facing toast flows for other scenarios.",
